# Antdrive
Magnettic loop antenna driver arduino shield for amateur radio HF

## Notes
Only one limit switch is pinned out as my setup limits torque such that the capacitor cannot be damaged on the other end. If using standard ethernet cable, you have another two lines (one twisted pair) that can be used for additional switches and signaling however.  I may add this at some point but I'm currently focused on other projects.
